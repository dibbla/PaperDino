# PaperDino

You may have seen the introduction of Everyday-arXiv:

> There are many researchers who keep checking papers on arXiv every day to keep up with the latest academic trends. Just like you can find a massive github repo, mainly a list of papers read daily by the repo maintainer. Everyday arXiv facilitates this habit. 

> As you browse arXiv updates, you can click into articles of interest and mark them with Everyday-arXiv for later reading. Everyday-arXiv keeps your mark history sorted by marking date.

PaperDino is a sidebar version extension with similar functions as Everyday-arXiv. In addition, it also support comment so you may leave a note for yourself when marking a new paper.
