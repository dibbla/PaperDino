[Everyday arXiv](https://github.com/dibbla/PaperDino-Everyday_arXiv/tree/main/Popup%20version) works with a popup window, while [PaperDino](https://github.com/dibbla/PaperDino-Everyday_arXiv/tree/main/Sidebar%20version) is presented in a sidebar. Please check the README.md in the corresponding directories for more details.

If you find any bug or issue, feel free to open up an issue. You are more than welcome to add another function & support more websites.

# Fun Fact

I started this project without any knowledge about front-end web development. I just want to test myself to tackle a real-life problem - Can I solve it? This extension still has many issues and can be further improved. But as a beginner of front-end development, I'm glad to see what I've done. Hope you enjoy it:beers:!
